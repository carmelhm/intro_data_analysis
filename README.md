# intro_data_analysis

Projects made during the training of Introduction to Data Analysis course at codeacademy

At this course I expect to learn

* Python basics
* Data visualisation with Matplotlib
* Analysis with Python
* Data manipulation with PandasHow
* Statistical Distributions with NumPy
* Hypothesis Testing with SciPy
* Data Retrieval with SQL

I'd like to apply this learning to some side project:

1. Movie data analysis
2. User behavioural data analysis
