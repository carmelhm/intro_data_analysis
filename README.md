# intro_data_analysis
Projects made during the training of Introduction to Data Analysis course at codeacademy

At this course I expect to learn 
- Python bascis
- Data visualisation with Matplotlib
- Analysis with Python
- Data manipulation with PandasHow 
- Statistical Distributions with NumPy
- Hypothesis Testing with SciPy

I'd like to apply this learning to a personal project oriented to analyse user behavioural data.
